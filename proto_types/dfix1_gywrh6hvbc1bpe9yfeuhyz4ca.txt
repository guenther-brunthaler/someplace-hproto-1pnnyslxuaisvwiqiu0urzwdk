"dfix1" (UUID gywrh6hvbc1bpe9yfeuhyz4ca): This is a decimal number with exactly one fractional digit. It is simply stored multiplied by 10 as an "int". This type is more space-efficient than "dfix4" if the fractional digit is frequently different from zero. Otherwise, if its is known that the vast majority of values to be encoded are in fact integral values without a fractional digit, "dfix4" will be more space-efficient. External types referenced from within this type definition: "int" (UUID gyj6jm8psufclh72ka1unkbct), "dfix4" (UUID gyyaivlt2292ecgiy53nz5l32). This is a sufficiently human-friendly format for manual decoding.
