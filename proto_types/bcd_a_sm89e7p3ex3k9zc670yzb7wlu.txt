"bcd_a" (UUID sm89e7p3ex3k9zc670yzb7wlu): Like "ubcd_a_0", except that a single ASCII period (".") character may also be included representing an optional decimal point. In addition, a leading ASCII hyphen ("-") may specifiy a negative sign. No "+" character or space padding is allowed. However, leading "0" digits (but still after any "-") may be used for padding. Note that this representation does not use the current locale, especially not LC_NUMERIC. Only the ASCII character set is supported. External types referenced from within this type definition: "ubcd_a_0" (UUID gz5ardls06vfgguraht0dl6wf). This is a sufficiently human-friendly format for manual decoding.
