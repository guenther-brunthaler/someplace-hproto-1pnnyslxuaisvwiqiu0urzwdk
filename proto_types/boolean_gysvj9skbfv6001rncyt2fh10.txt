"boolean" (UUID gysvj9skbfv6001rncyt2fh10): A restricted subtype of "uint" where only the values 0 and 1 are allowed. Note that this is actually a tri-state rather than a real boolean value, because the value can also be NULL if the field is not present at all in the message encoding. NULL could then be interpreted as a third state "maybe" or "undecided". Encoded the same as "uint", including the optimization that an empty <field_contents> represents the value 0 (and thus "false"). However, when defining a default value for such a field, only the words "true" and "false" shall be allowed in a message definition. You can define your own "bool" if you don't like this definition. External types referenced from within this type definition: "uint" (UUID gyic709md7c9icf8wl1akdcq7).
