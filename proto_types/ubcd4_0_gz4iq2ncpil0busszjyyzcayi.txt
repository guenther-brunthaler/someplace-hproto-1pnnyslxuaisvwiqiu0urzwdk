"ubcd4_0" (UUID gz4iq2ncpil0busszjyyzcayi): Packed binary coded decimal. Every decimal digit is packed into 4 bits of an unsigned integer of arbitrary size. This integer is then encoded as an "uint". For instance, the decimal value 3456 will be encoded resulting in a hex dump 0x34 0x56. This type does not provide a sign (the "u" means "unsigned") or fractional digits (that's the "_0"-part). External types referenced from within this type definition: "uint" (UUID gyic709md7c9icf8wl1akdcq7). This is a sufficiently human-friendly format for manual decoding.
