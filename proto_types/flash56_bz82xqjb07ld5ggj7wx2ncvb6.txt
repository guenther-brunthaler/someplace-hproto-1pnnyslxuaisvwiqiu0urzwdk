"flash56" (UUID bz82xqjb07ld5ggj7wx2ncvb6): A floating-slash rational number with a denominator up to 56 bit. This is basically the same as "flash28", except that the bit field represented by the 3 least significant bit is now called <octs> instead of <quads>. It represents the number of 8-bit units which represent the denominator. This encoding is typically used for 64-bit floating-slash numbers. Encoded as an uint resulting from the expression `(<numerator> * 2 ** (8 * <octs> + 4)) + <denominator> * 2 ** 4 + <sign> * 4 + <octs>)`. The serialized numbers contain the following packed bit-fields, starting from the right side: 3 bits for <octs>, 1 bit for <sign>, <octs>*8 bits for the denominator, then all the remaining bits representing the numerator. See "flash28" for the rules what <octs> == 0 implies as well as about infinities and NaN.
