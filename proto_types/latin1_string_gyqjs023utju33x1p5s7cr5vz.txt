"latin1_string" (UUID gyqjs023utju33x1p5s7cr5vz) - a UNICODE string which is restricted to the first 256 UNICODE code points, also known as the LATIN1 or ISO-8859-1 character set. Note that this type is probably not very useful any more as it cannot represent the EURO sign. However, it is the most compact and powerful encoding of UNICODE which does not contain any multi-byte encodings. It is also a superset of ASCII and contains most umlauts and diacritics used by western languages. "latin1_string" is binary equivalent to "octetstring" but not necessarily the same as "ascii", because the latter one might use 7-bit bytes. Neither is "latin1_string" necessarily binary equivalent to "bytestring", because the latter one might also use 7, 9 or more bits per byte. External types referenced from within this type definition: "octetstring" (UUID smc8gywnq3bpmutkpgqawm870), "ascii" (UUID gyrbdijh4rkvhd68pptqwftne), "bytestring" (UUID smd1ish29drr4cu3mvj84pfva). This is a sufficiently human-friendly format for manual decoding.
