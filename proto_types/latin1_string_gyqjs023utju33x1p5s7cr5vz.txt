"latin1_string" (UUID gyqjs023utju33x1p5s7cr5vz) - a UNICODE string which is restricted to the first 256 UNICODE code points, also known as the LATIN1 or ISO-8859-1 character set. Note that this type is probably not very useful any more as it cannot represent the EURO sign. However, it is the most compact and powerful encoding of UNICODE which does not contain any multi-byte encodings. It is also a superset of ASCII and contains most umlauts and diacritics used by western languages.
