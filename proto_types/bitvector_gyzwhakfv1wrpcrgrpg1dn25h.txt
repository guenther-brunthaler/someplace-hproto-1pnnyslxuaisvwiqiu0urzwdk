"bitvector" (UUID gyzwhakfv1wrpcrgrpg1dn25h): This is a binary packed array of bits, stored as an "octetstring". The first octet stores the bits with indexes 0-7, the second octet stores bits 8-15, etc. Within every octet, the least significant bit stores the bit with the lowest array index of that octet, and the most significant bit refers to the highest array index of that octet. It is allowed to write bits beyond the current actual size of the array, bitvector will automatically be enlarged if necessary. There is an infinite number of virtual "0"-bits beyond the last actually allocated octet in the array, which will be returned when reading without growing the array. This allows the optimization that a "bitvector" with 0 octets of <field_contents> will actually represent a vector filled with infinite many "0" bits. Also, writing a "0"-bit will never grow the array for the same reason. The API shall provide the information what the highest actually allocated bitvector-index is. Because bits are not necessarily booleans, the values "0" and "1" are considered to be small integers, rather than abstract symbols like "true" or "false".
