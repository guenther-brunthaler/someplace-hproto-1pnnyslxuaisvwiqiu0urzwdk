"globaldatetime" (UUID gz3qrkpbplr3dtik2cs3au3i7): This is in fact a predefined "message globaldatetime {serialdate date:0; serialtime time:1 = 0; tzoffset tzo15m:2 = 0}" which contains everything necessary to compare two timestamps taken at two possibly different places (with regard to the timezone) on possibly different dates. Note that the timezone resulting from the default value for tzo15m will be UTC.
