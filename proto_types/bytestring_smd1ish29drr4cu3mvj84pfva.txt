"bytestring" (UUID smd1ish29drr4cu3mvj84pfva) - A string containing binary bytes that are not necessarily text but may as well be such. A string of whatever your C compiler considers to be a "char". Obviously this is implementation-specific and thus not portable. However, it is fine for mashalling data between different processes or threads on the same machine, or between machines known to use the same number of bits in a byte. Consider using the more specific "octetstring" instead of "bytestring" if the serialized data may be written into non-temporary files. External types referenced from within this type definition: "octetstring" (UUID smc8gywnq3bpmutkpgqawm870). This is a sufficiently human-friendly format for manual decoding.
