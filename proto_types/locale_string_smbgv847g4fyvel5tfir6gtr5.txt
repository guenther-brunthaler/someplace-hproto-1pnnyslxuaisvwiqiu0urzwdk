"locale_string" (UUID smbgv847g4fyvel5tfir6gtr5) - A text string using the character set and encoding defined by the locale which is currently in effect by the process where the string originated from, whatever it may be. This is an inherently non-portable encoding, because even processes running on the same local machine might use different locales at the same time. However, the type should be safe to use for communication with sibling processes forked from the same parent process, unless one of the processes changes its locale after forking. It is also safe for communication with different threads within the same process, because there is only one locale per process. (Assuming none of the threads change the locale since the first thread has been spawned.)
