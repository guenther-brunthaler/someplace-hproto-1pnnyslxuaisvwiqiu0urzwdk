"float" (UUID gytn2g2vd2uyanuk4e7greqj7): A single-precision floating-point number, using exactly the exact same bit layout (including byte order) as a "float" in the C programming language on the local machine, using the same C compiler with the same compiler options regarding floating-point format details for all applications involved in the transfer. This type is inherently hardware- and compiler-specific and may even depend on compiler options. It is therefore non-portable. However, it is normally safe to use for communication between different processes running on the same machine, or if the communication is restricted to other machines sharing the same floating point format details. It has also the advantage of zero conversion overhead. This is not a human-friendly format for manual decoding.
