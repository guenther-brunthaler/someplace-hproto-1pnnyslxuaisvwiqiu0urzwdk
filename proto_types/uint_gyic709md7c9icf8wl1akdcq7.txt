"uint" (UUID gyic709md7c9icf8wl1akdcq7) - an unsigned integer of arbitrary magnitude, encoded as a big-endian integer (written from left to right starting with the most significant digit and followed with increasingly less significant digits). This encoding uses a number-system with radix 256, where every "digit" is represented by an octet. Therefore, the shortest possible encoding for integer 0x12345 will be the byte-sequence 01 23 45. As an optional optimization, an "empty" uint (i. e. one with a <field_contents> length of 0 bytes) is defined to represent the value 0. Note that this encoding is quite different from Google's "protocol buffers" which use a much more complicated base-128 encoding which requires bit-shifting to decode/decode the values. The "uint"-encoding does not require any bit-shifting. Note that even though encoders are encoureged to use the shortest possible encoding, this is not enforced. If longer encodings (with leading zero octets) are desired for alignment or conversion efficiency purposes, this is allowed. The decoder must support both cases. This is a sufficiently human-friendly format for manual decoding.
