"ubcd_a_0" (UUID gz5ardls06vfgguraht0dl6wf): Like "ubcd8_0", except that ASCII digit codes are used instead of binary digit values. For instance, the decimal value 3456 will be encoded resulting in a hex dump 0x33 0x34 0x35 0x36 which is the same as the ASCII string representing the value. "ubcd_a_0" thus means "store the number (which has no fractional part) as ASCII text using ASCII decimal digits". Note that this is an 8-bit encoding, even though ASCII is only a 7-bit character set. So this is actually more an 8-bit LATIN1-encoding than 7-bit ASCII, but the character code values used by this encoding are the same in ASCII and LATIN1.
