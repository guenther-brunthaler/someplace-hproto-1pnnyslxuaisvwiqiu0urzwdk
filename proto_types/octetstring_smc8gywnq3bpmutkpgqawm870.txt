"octetstring" (UUID smc8gywnq3bpmutkpgqawm870) - A string containing binary 8-bit bytes (so-called "octets") that are not necessarily text but may as well be such. Should be used if it is important/relevant that the string consists of 8-bit bytes. Note that a "byte" can have any number of bits (usually 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 depending on the native character set size or the native word size of the machine), but an octet always has exactly 8 bits.
