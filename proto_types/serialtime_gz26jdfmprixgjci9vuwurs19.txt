"serialtime" (UUID gz26jdfmprixgjci9vuwurs19): The number of seconds elapsed since midnight of some day at some place, always using the time zone offset which was in effect at exactly that time at that place. Let's say, at the start of that day daylight saving was not in effect, but later that day it became effective. If serialtime is calculated from a time before daylight saving became active, it is based on the same "tzoffset" as the start of the day. Otherwise, it is based on the same "tzoffset" as the next day, which already includes the daylight saving offset. It assumes all minutes have exactly 60 seconds. The conversion of "serialtime" and HH:MM:SS is based on calendar time, and will not care about leap seconds (encoding some time [$MM]:60 will decode incorrectly as [$MM+1]:00 - the Linux "date" utility has exactly the same problem). This means "serialtime"-values will never be larger than 24 hours, even if daylight saving started or ended during that day. Even though the conversion itself does not care about leap seconds, the operating system functions which get the current HH:MM:SS normally do. So, as long as the time is actually obtained from such a function before converting it to "serialtime", the time expressed by that "serialtime" value will be correct subtracting two such values will usually calculate the correct time difference, including any leap seconds. This assumes the time stamps are from the same place and date, however. Otherwise, you need to include the "tzoffset" as well as the "serialdate" in the calculation as well, or the timestamps will not be comparable.
