"ubcd4e4" (UUID sm923fbun8pipd4ctcibiuzb6): Packed 4-bit BCD digits where the least significant digit is replaced by a 4-bit (positive) exponent in the range 0x00 to 0x0f. Basically stored as an "ubcd4_0", except that the least-significant 4 bits are interpreted as the exponent. For instance, the decimal value 34 will be stored giving a hex dump of 0x03 0x40. Which means the digits "3" and "4" and zero fractional digits. The value 3.14159 would give 0x03 0x14 0x15 0x95 because there are 5 fractional digits. Note that the exponent cannot be negative. The value "1000" will therefore still be encoded with an exponent of 0 because there are no fractional digits, rather than encoding it as 1.0E-3 which is not supported here. External types referenced from within this type definition: "ubcd4_0" (UUID gz4iq2ncpil0busszjyyzcayi). This is a limited human-friendly format for manual decoding.
