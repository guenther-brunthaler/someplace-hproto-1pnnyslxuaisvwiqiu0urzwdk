"rational" (UUID gyz30dlebhg9y0dekh413kn2p): This is in fact a predefined "message rational {int numerator:0 = 1; uint denominator:1 = 1}" which contains everything necessary store a fraction exactly. The fraction does not need to be normalized, although the application is of course free to do so. The following special values are supported: INF == +1/0, -INF == -1/0, IND/QNaN == 0/0. Note that there are an infinite number of additional ways to represent INF and -INF, but only the values above shall be taken as actual synonyms. There is no plain NaN. It is implementation-defined whether display formatting functions use the symbolic names or just display numerator and denominator as-is, i. e. as numbers.
