"tzoffset" (UUID gz1fptrrtfvz54bv0re1pd8nq): The offset of some time zone (typically the local one) from UTC, encoded as an "int", expressed as 15-minute-intervals (most time zone offsets are whole hours, but some are offset by 30 or 45 minutes - all of those can be expressed as multiples of 15 minute intervals). The value 0 means UTC. In other words, time_as_UTC + 15 * tzoffset * minutes == time_in_associated_timezone.
