"tzoffset" (UUID gz1fptrrtfvz54bv0re1pd8nq): The offset of some time zone (typically the local one) from UTC, encoded as an "int", expressed as 15-minute-intervals (most time zone offsets are whole hours, but some are offset by 30 or 45 minutes - all of those can be expressed as multiples of 15 minute intervals). The value 0 means UTC. In other words, `time_as_UTC + 15 * tzoffset * minutes == time_in_associated_timezone`. Example: A time zone offset written as "`-0700`" in an RFC-822 e-mail message would result in an "int" with value `-7 * 4 == -28` to be encoded. The factor 4 is due to the fact that every whole hour contains `4 * 15` minutes. External types referenced from within this type definition: "int" (UUID gyj6jm8psufclh72ka1unkbct). This is not a human-friendly format for manual decoding.
