"ubcd8_0" (UUID gz5ardls06vfgguraht0dl6wf): Like "bcd4_0", except that every decimal digit is packed into 8 bits of the integer. This requires twice the space, but bit shifting is unnecessary for input/output conversion. For instance, the decimal value 3456 will be encoded resulting in a hex dump 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06. External types referenced from within this type definition: "ubcd4_0" (UUID gz4iq2ncpil0busszjyyzcayi). This is a sufficiently human-friendly format for manual decoding.
