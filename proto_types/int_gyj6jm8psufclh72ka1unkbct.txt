"int" (UUID gyj6jm8psufclh72ka1unkbct) - a signed integer of arbitrary magnitude. This is encoded as an "uint" after "zig-zag"-encoding the signed integer value as an unsigned integer. Zig-zag-encoding maps signed integers into unsigned ones as follows: 0, -1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, -4, 4, ... are mapped to unsigned 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ..., respectively. The mapping alternates between mapping the next unsigned number and the next signed number not yet mapped. The unsigned numbers start with 0 and the signed numbers start with -1. Note that this zig-zag-mapping has been "borrowed" from Google's 'protocol buffers'. But also note that the resulting "uint" will be encoded differently than in 'protocol buffers'. External types referenced from within this type definition: "uint" (UUID gyic709md7c9icf8wl1akdcq7). This is a not a human-friendly format for manual decoding.
