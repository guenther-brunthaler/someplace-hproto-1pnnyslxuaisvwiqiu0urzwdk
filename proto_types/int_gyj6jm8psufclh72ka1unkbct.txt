"int" (UUID gyj6jm8psufclh72ka1unkbct) - a signed integer of arbitrary magnitude. This is encoded as an "uint" after "zig-zag"-encoding the signed integer value as an unsigned integer. Zig-zag-encoding maps signed integers into unsigned ones as follows: 0, -1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, -4, 4, ... are mapped to unsigned 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ..., respectively. The encoding alternates by describing the next unsigned number and the next signed number not yet described. The unsigned numbers start with 0 and the signed numbers start with -1. Note that this zig-zag-encoding has been "borrowed" from Google's protocol buffers.
