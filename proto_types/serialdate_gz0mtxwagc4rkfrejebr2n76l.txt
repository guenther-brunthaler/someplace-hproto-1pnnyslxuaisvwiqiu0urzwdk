"serialdate" (UUID gz0mtxwagc4rkfrejebr2n76l): The number of days between 2000-01-01 and a given target date at the same place, both dates specified in the local time of that place. This number is internally expressed (and encoded as) an "int". That is, 2000-01-01 is encoded as 0, 2000-01-02 is encoded as +1, 1999-12-31 is encoded as -1, etc. The calculations are done using the rules of the Gegorian calender, which is the standard in Western countries, and was introduced on 1582-10-15, which is also the earliest date which should be represented as a "serialdate". Leap seconds cannot have any effect on the calculation, because only whole days are considered.
