"any_string" (UUID gyjyupanxic0dp96zzw4cw2zk) - A text string of unspecified encoding or character set. Use this to pass through string values where the encoding is not just unknown or subject to change, but may even contain different encodings within the same string. For instance, some source code formats support directives to declare the character set to be used from this point onward until another directive changes it again.
