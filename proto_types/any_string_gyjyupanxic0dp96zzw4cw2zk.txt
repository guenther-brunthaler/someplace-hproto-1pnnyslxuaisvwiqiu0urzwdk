"any_string" (UUID gyjyupanxic0dp96zzw4cw2zk) - A text string of unspecified encoding or character set. Use this to pass through string values where the encoding is not just unknown or subject to change, but may even contain different encodings within the same string. For instance, some source code formats support directives to declare the character set to be used from this point onward until another directive changes it again. Note that "string" is very simular to "any_string". The difference is that "string" is expected to use the same unknown character set and encoding for all of its characters, while "any_string" allows multiple different character sets and encodings mixed within the same string. "any_string" should also be used instead of "locale_string" if different parts of the same string might have been obtained using different locales (i.e. "setlocale()" has been called multiple times with different arguments, each time producing another part of the string). External types referenced from within this type definition: "string" (UUID smap94sqt5kfn6pee6ash6qr1), "locale_string" (UUID smbgv847g4fyvel5tfir6gtr5). This is a sufficiently human-friendly format for manual decoding.
