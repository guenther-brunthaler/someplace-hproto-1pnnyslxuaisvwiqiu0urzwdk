"s9bcd4e4" (UUID smekzqub39l4p1r5bphthgb4i): Same as "s10bcd4e4", except that 9's complement is used for negative numbers. The most significant digit still represents the sign in the same way. However, instead of subtracting the absolute value of a negative number like explained for "s10bcd4e4", each digit of the absolute value is subtracted from "9". For instance, in order to encode -123.4, we first drop the sign and add a leading "0" to make the encoding fit into an integral number of octets. Now we have the number "0123.4" and need to subtract all its digit from "9", giving "9876.5". This is then encoded as a "ubcd4e4", yielding a hex dump of 0x98 0x76 0x51. (The "1" is the exponent). External types referenced from within this type definition: "s10bcd4e4" (UUID sm9winegqnwb5kyfrqxcf4k8r), "ubcd4e4" (UUID sm923fbun8pipd4ctcibiuzb6).
